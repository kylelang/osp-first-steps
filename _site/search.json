In most cases, you only need to specify the name of the package that you want to install in the install.packages() function. The following code will install the psych package.\n\n## Use the default CRAN mirror to install one package\ninstall.packages(\"psych\")\n\nIf you want to install more than one package, you simply using the concatenation function, c(), to define a character vector giving the names of your desired packages, as shown in the following code.\n\n## Use the default CRAN mirror to install two packages\ninstall.packages(c(\"mice\", \"lavaan\"))\n\nIn the ordinary use-case, install.packages() will download the data needed to install a given package from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). CRAN is a global network of servers (so-called CRAN mirrors) that each host a complete copy of the database of the available R packages (as well as the Base R components).\nUsually, you don’t need to tell R which of these CRAN mirrors to use because RStudio defines a default mirror that gets used whenever you call install.pacakges(). However, if you want to explicitly specify a different CRAN mirror, you can do so via the repos argument.\n\n## Specify the CRAN mirror a priori\ninstall.packages(c(\"lattice\", \"gridExtra\"), repos = \"http://cloud.r-project.org\")\n\nSimilarly, you don’t usually have to tell R where you want to install new packages. If your user doesn’t have write permissions for the default library location, R will ask if you want to install the packages in a different location for which you should have suitable permissions.\nSometimes, this automatic procedure fails (e.g., on employer-administered computers with strict security settings for employees). In such cases—or anytime you want to explicitly define the package library location—you can define the package library via the lib argument.\n\n## Specify a non-standard directory into which the packages will be installed\ninstall.packages(\"mvtnorm\", lib = \"../software\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice\n\n\n\nUse the install.packages() function to install the following packages in the default location (i.e., don’t specify anything for the lib argument).\n\nggplot2\ndplyr\nhaven\n\n\n Interactive Editor Solution\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"ggplot2\", \"dplyr\", \"haven\"))"

    "text": "How Functions Work\nIn most cases, R functions work in the same way as mathematical functions:\n\nAccept some input\nPerform some operation on the input\nReturn the results of the operation\n\nFor example, the following equation represents a linear function of \\(x\\).\n\\[\nf(x) = 1.5 + 2x\n\\]\nFor any value of \\(x\\) that we provide as input, \\(f(x)\\) will first multiply that value by 3 and then add 1.5 to the resulting product. So, if we let \\(x = 3\\), we get \\(f(3) = 7.5\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nf(3) &= 1.5 + 2 \\times 3\\\\\n&= 7.5\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThe mean() function that we used to motivate these ideas operates through the same conceptual process. In terms of a mathematical function, you can think of the R function call mean(1:5) as supplying the input \\(x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\\) to a function, \\(f(x)\\), that computes the arithmetic mean of the values in \\(x\\).\nIf we let \\(n\\) represent the number of values in \\(x\\), we could notate the mathematical representation of the mean() function as follows.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nIn programming jargon, we would call Equation 1 the definition of the mean function. That is, we’ve defined a tool that we can use to compute the mean of any given set of values, but we haven’t yet used that tool to compute an actual mean.\nTo use our defined function to compute a mean, we need to apply \\(f(x)\\) to some input, say, \\(a = [1, \\ldots, 5]\\). After replacing the variable \\(x\\) on the right hand side of Equation 1 with the input data \\(a\\), we can compute the mean, \\(f(a)\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nf(a) &= \\frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5}{5}\\\\\n&= 3\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nDoing the analagous calculation in R would look like the following.\n\na &lt;- 1:5\nmean(a)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nIn most of your R analyses, you won’t need to worry about defining the functions you use: that work has already been done by the developers who wrote the packages you’re using. You will usually only have to worry about preparing the inputs, calling an appropriate function, and processing the function’s output."

    "text": "Function Arguments\nWhen you call an R function, you will specify the function inputs by defining values for the function’s arguments. R function arguments are named, and most R functions have multiple arguments. You specify the argument values by writing a comma-separated list of name-value pairs between the parentheses of the function call. For example, the following code creates a vector of 100 random normal deviates, dat, and computes the trimmed mean of dat excluding the most extreme 10% of the values.\n\ndat &lt;- rnorm(n = 100)\nmean(x = dat, trim = 0.05)\n\n[1] 0.024512\n\n\nThere are some nuances to how we specify the arguments when we call an R function. Most importantly, we don’t always need to explicitly write out the argument’s name, and we don’t necessarily need to provide a value for all arguments. Before we can make much headway on these finer points, however, we need to answer a couple unresolved questions:\n\nWhere are all these mysterious R functions defined, and how do I access new functions?\nHow do I know a function’s arguments and what values to specify for those arguments?\n\nIn the next two tutorials, you will learn about R packages (the source of most R functions) and R’s documentation system (the means by which you will learn how to use new functions). We will revisit the finer points of calling R functions when we discuss documentation.\n\n\n\nContinue\n\nNext Topic Restart Topic"
